# OpenMontage

**MANDATORY: Read `AGENT_GUIDE.md` before responding to ANY user message.**

Do not act on the user's request until you have read AGENT_GUIDE.md.
It contains routing rules that determine your first action based on what the user asked.
Skipping it WILL cause you to take the wrong action.

Production instructions are in AGENT_GUIDE.md.

For this machine's runtime and credential setup, also read `LOCAL_SETUP.md` if it exists.
For Ark calls, reuse the running session described there (ping the saved session handle
before using it); do not start a new `op run` for every API call. If the session has
ended, start the documented launcher once and retain its session ID. Never save the
resolved API key to disk. This does not change production approval or pipeline rules.
